Investigated genomic sequences on python, found that the magnitude of the sequence divided by the entropy was a good metric for prediction of taxonomic level, called this metric "magtropy". In these colab notebooks we are testing the magtropy metric to see the confusion matrix for the classification of Sars-Cov-2 into each taxonomic level.
